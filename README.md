## **🏗️ Project Details by Parts**

### **📌 Part 1: Foundation**
- 🛠️ Introduced the SQL database running on port `3306`.
- 🗂️ Established the foundational application structure:
  - Database connectivity.
  - Initial testing setups.

### **📌 Part 2: Feature Enhancement**
- ✨ Enhanced the application with additional features.
- 🌍 Ensured compatibility with multi-environment setups.
- 🔄 Focused on modularizing components for streamlined integrations.

### **📌 Part 3: Testing & Pipeline Integration**
- 🔧 Modified the testing pipeline:
  - SQL testing connections use port `3307` to avoid conflicts with local development databases.
  - Docker maps the `3307` port to the SQL container's `3306` port for isolated testing.
- 🧪 Extended the Jenkins pipeline with:
  - Advanced testing scripts.
  - Deployment mechanisms.

### **📌 Part 4: Full Deployment**
- 🌐 Completed the full deployment cycle using Kubernetes and Helm.
- ⚖️ Implemented load balancing and scalability enhancements.
- ✅ Finalized testing frameworks for production-like reliability validation.

## **🌟 Key Features**

1. **💾 SQL Database Integration**:
   - Configured an SQL database to run on port `3306` for local development in Part 1.
   - Enabled conflict-free testing by using port `3307` for test environments in Part 3 (with Docker port mapping).

2. **🤖 Pipeline Automation**:
   - Automated development workflows with a Jenkins pipeline:
     - Code pull.
     - Testing.
     - Image building.
     - Deployment.
   - Integrated custom scripts for reproducible and reliable application workflows.

3. **📦 Containerized Deployment**:
   - Dockerized application components to ensure environment consistency.
   - Kubernetes provided orchestration and scalability for the deployed containers.

4. **✅ Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Designed isolated testing environments to maintain local development stability.
   - Ensured workflow integrity through multiple testing scripts.
