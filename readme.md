# Project Introduction

This project represents a comprehensive and modular approach to deploying and testing a modern application stack. The system is built with scalability and flexibility in mind, leveraging various technologies and adhering to a structured pipeline for streamlined development, testing, and deployment.

---

## **Key Features**

1. **SQL Database Integration**:
   - In the first part of the project, an SQL database is configured to run on port `3306` for local development purposes.
   - To avoid conflicts with an existing SQL instance on localhost during testing, the third part introduces a change where test scripts connect to port `3307`. Docker seamlessly maps this to the SQL container's `3306` port, enabling isolated and conflict-free testing.

2. **Pipeline Automation**:
   - A Jenkins pipeline is utilized to automate code pull, testing, image building, and deployment stages.
   - Custom scripts are integrated into the pipeline to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of application workflows.

3. **Containerized Deployment**:
   - Docker is used to containerize the application components, ensuring environment consistency across different stages of development.
   - Kubernetes manages the deployment of these containers, providing scalability and orchestration.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Multiple testing scripts ensure the integrity of both individual components and the entire application workflow.
   - Testing environments are isolated to maintain stability in the local development setup.

- Established the foundational application structure, including database connectivity and initial testing setups.

### **Part 2**
- Enhanced the application with additional features and ensured compatibility with multi-environment setups.
- Focused on modularizing components to streamline further integrations.

### **Part 3**
- Modified the testing pipeline to use port `3307` for SQL connections during testing.
- Integrated Docker's port mapping to manage testing without disrupting local development environments.
- Extended the Jenkins pipeline with advanced testing scripts and deployment mechanisms.

### **Part 4**
